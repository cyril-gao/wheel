In the book 《Introduction to Algorithms 3rd edition》 from the chapter 22 to the chapter 26 many algorithms related to graph are explicated. Here I provide real code to implement these algorithms by using C++, Python and TypeScript.

BTW, in my opinion, I think that the chapter 1.5 in the book 《Algorithms Fourth Edition》 is better than the chapter 21 in the book 《Introduction to Algorithms 3rd edition》 .
